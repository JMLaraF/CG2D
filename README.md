# CG2D
Is the computher Grapichs Repositorie for the practices in 3D

I going to add things to this repository as it advances, the important features are:
-Bresehand algorithm to evaluate the lines.
-Line Scan algorithm to fill convex poligons.
-Rotation function to rotate a line respect the Origin.
-Perspective camera.
-Proyection and ligthing of 3D figures in a vector format.

CAMERA
-can be rotate from the origin
-move from them also
-change the focus distance

Ligth
you can change the parameters a , b , c
for a*x^2+ b*x + c for the atenuation
and r , g ,b for the color of the ligth


to run compile with C++ 11 -- >  g++ 2DLineDrawer_02.cpp -std=c++11
and run givin a raw file format to make the picture
